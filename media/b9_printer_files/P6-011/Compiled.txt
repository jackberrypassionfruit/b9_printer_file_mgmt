This part printed badly. The root is way shorter than it should be. I think this is a known issue with printer 596. You can scrap this part so the job can move along.

Thanks Rob.   Are all of these jobs going to need to be manually moved back to the step they were at before the rework once through CT?  Mostly they will be going back to either CMM or Final Visual, I believe.  Importantly, we want to avoid parts that already have CMM data from having to go back through CMM.

These are the scans that I see so far today. 3 of them do not match our naming convention. The "SR" is supposed to be capitalized but on these 3 scans it is lower case. I suspect that this is preventing these from processing. The others seem to be processing normally. I will monitor. 📷

Sherman, Jeff
9/20 2:48 PM

In case it hasn't been fully communicated to everyone: the reason these jobs had to be sent back is that parts were touching each other in scans that included parts from all of these jobs. When parts are touching each other, even by the most tiny amount, the CT scanner is completely unable to distinguish one part from another and the entire scan is compromised. Please, take all the time you need to be absolutely sure that no parts are touching. Double check the parts after placing the fixture in the machine; sometimes parts can shift around while you are moving them into the machine.

The chiller isn't intended to reduce the cabinet temperature below the temperature of the lab. It is just intended to keep the temperature in the cabinet constant and remove the additional heat that is released into the cabinet by the X-ray tube. So there should be no need for "cool down" period when it starts back up assuming the lab temperature has been holding in its expected range.

Assuming it was the last scan record created it should be SR33452, but please confirm the Part IDs for that scan match up with the parts you have loaded in the fixture.

 

Since you wont be able to scan the 'Project Name' into the scanner UI please type '251021_SR33452' (without the quotes) and double check that you typed it correctly. A typo will cause the scan to not process and need to re rescanned later.

The part in 6225507 was flagged as a dummy. It looks like there was an error in the back-end creating the scan record. I will get Jack to correct it in the back end and then the part will process through.

 

For the other 2 jobs, as I have said before, and especially if the part has not gone through sort yet, please verify that there aren't any giant holes in any parts that get quarantined. You can safely assume if the part looks like any in the pictures below that they will not process and can be scrapped.

In general, scans of parts not at final are not held up from moving for incomplete data. It's not a good use of time to look into parts from engineering trials that are quarantined since there are countless failure modes that can be introduced by the trial. If the engineer needs the data they can come to Metrology to get it later.

To be clear: this has nothing to do with the UI. The problem is coming from the x-ray tube and is being reported out by the x-ray tube monitoring software. This is completely separate from our UI. If it works it will work with either UI and if it is doesn’t it will fail equally in both UIs.

yesterday when they switched over to the new UI it started working.  maybe it was coincidence.  

 

What matters is we are 80 parts short on our shipment because nothing has moved at CT since I left last night apparently.

 

What are our options to solve this problem?

Sherman, Jeff
10/24 2:49 AM
The problem is excess leakage current. That means that electrical current that is supposed to to be focused in a tight beam on a single point on the target is instead “leaking” somewhere else. It’s an electrical isolation or  electrical potential issue. The target is electrically isolated by a ceramic ring. If you rotate the target it could possibly change something about that isolation and get this working.

Anderson, Nick
10/24 7:48 AM

Since we are in a time crunch to get thes parts processed and the last artifact scan was close to failing I am recommending we scan the artifact every hour in order to lock in and confirm the scans we ran prior are not going to need to be rescanned. Along with this I recommend that we do not move jobs untill the artifact bracket is comuted and shows passing. This is indicated in the rebatch page under the scan number associated with each part. If it says 'Not Closed' there is not data for the closing bracket to validate the scan data. See below.

Bild

 

If the artifact failed, it will also be indicated here. In this case the parts will need to be rescanned after the next passing artifact scan.

Bild

 

Once the scan number is black with no message for each part in a job, the job can be moved.

Bild

 

 

I will monitor the artifact results and if we trend away from the spec, and the risk of failuire drops, I will update this chat to indicate that we can scan the artifact on a less frequent basis.

hey folks, last night we had an unusual number of parts fail dimensional.  these were early version EP-600 trials that came from P6C and were "high fire CT" scanned per the router. How confident should we be that those parts would have failed Final CT if we had patched them?  I'd like to stop doing these scans if the data is not needed for older trials, however i also don't want to patch a large number of parts that are going to fail final CT

Anderson, Nick
11/5 8:21 AM

The only way I can think that a part that fails at high fire would pass at final would be that there is a void on an inspection surface that gets patched. The void would cause the feature to fail at high fire and if it is patched in a way that returns it to a conforming state it would possibly pass. I don't think that this is likely to be a high occurrence event though.

Hi Folks,

Current plan for final CT 1028s is to hold a job back if there are 4 or more parts failing dimensional.

If 3 or fewer fail, we are going to scrap those parts in the system and move the job along but not physically destroy them.  We have two clearly marked "QC Rejected" foams at CT that we will stash them in, in case there is a path to revive them later.

If holding a job back please share that that job # out to Scan Clan chat. (as Hue just did)

ok, in the future don't re-run the whole homing process if the post-homing scan passes. Homing can introduce error occasionally (which is why we run an artifact after) and it looks like the first time you corrected the error then, when you ran it again, introduced it back.
